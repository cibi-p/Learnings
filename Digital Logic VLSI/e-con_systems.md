1's and 2's complement, 9's and 10's complement

### **Binary Codes**  
**BCD**

BCD, single number is represented by 0000 to 1001 (0 to 9)  
ex: 821 is represented as 1000 0010 0001  
Advantage of the BCD over binary code is that it represrest the decimal value
in BCD to represent negatve number we use 9's and 10's complete (subracting the every digit with 9 and finally and 1 to the number) ex: -240 is 760 abfer 9's and 10's complement (actual it also prodcuce +9 as carry which is discarded)

**Other Binary codes are `2421, Excess-3 , (8,4,-2,-1)`**  

BCD adders add BCD values directly, digit by digit, without converting the numbers
to binary. However, it is necessary to add 6 to the result if it is greater than 9. BCD
adders require significantly more hardware and no longer have a speed advantage of
conventional binary adders [5].
The 2421 and the excess‐3 codes are examples of self‐complementing codes. Such
codes have the property that the 9’s complement of a decimal number is obtained
directly by changing 1’s to 0’s and 0’s to 1’s (i.e., by complementing each bit in the pat-
tern). For example, decimal 395 is represented in the excess‐3 code as 0110 1100 1000.
The 9’s complement of 604 is represented as 1001 0011 0111, which is obtained simply
by complementing each bit of the code (as with the 1’s complement of binary numbers).
The excess‐3 code has been used in some older computers because of its self‐
complementing property. Excess‐3 is an unweighted code in which each coded com-
bination is obtained from the corresponding binary value plus 3. Note that the BCD
code is not self‐complementing.
The 8, 4, -2, -1 code is an example of assigning both positive and negative weights
to a decimal code. In this case, the bit combination 0110 is interpreted as decimal 2 and
is calculated from 8 * 0 + 4 * 1 + ( -2) * 1 + ( -1) * 0 = 2.

**Gray Code**  
The output data of many physical systems are quantities that are continuous. These
data must be converted into digital form before they are applied to a digital system.
Continuous or analog information is converted into digital form by means of an ana-
log‐to‐digital converter. It is sometimes convenient to use the Gray code shown in
Table 1.6 to represent digital data that have been converted from analog data. The
advantage of the Gray code over the straight binary number sequence is that only
one bit in the code group changes in going from one number to the next. For example,
in going from 7 to 8, the Gray code changes from 0100 to 1100. Only the first bit
changes, from 0 to 1; the other three bits remain the same. By contrast, with binary
numbers the change from 7 to 8 will be from 0111 to 1000, which causes all four bits
to change values.  

The Gray code is used in applications in which the normal sequence of binary numbers
generated by the hardware may produce an error or ambiguity during the transition from
one number to the next. If binary numbers are used, a change, for example, from 0111 to
1000 may produce an intermediate erroneous number 1001 if the value of the rightmost
bit takes longer to change than do the values of the other three bits. This could have seri-
ous consequences for the machine using the information. The Gray code eliminates this
problem, since only one bit changes its value during any transition between two numbers.

A typical application of the Gray code is the representation of analog data by a con-
tinuous change in the angular position of a shaft. The shaft is partitioned into segments,
and each segment is assigned a number. If adjacent segments are made to correspond
with the Gray‐code sequence, ambiguity is eliminated between the angle of the shaft
and the value encoded by the sensor.

## Chapter 2: Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates

- Huntington Posutulates (6 Properties)
- Duality properties
- Boolean functions (ex: function of x'y'z+x'yz+xy' is reduced to x'z(y'+y)+xy', therefore y'+y is always 1. so, final reduced function is x'z+xy' and it requires less gates to create this function, it implies the use of boolean algebra)
- Canonical and standard form(refer book pg. No. 51)

 ## Important tips
1. XOR Gate produce one if the number of 1 is odd (ex: suppose for 3 input, XOR output will be 1 if the count of 1's in the input is odd)

## Chapter 4: Combinational Logic

Logic circuits for digital systems may be combinational or sequential. A combinational
circuit consists of logic gates whose outputs at any time are determined from only the
present combination of inputs.
