# Class of Devices and Modules
There three fundamental devices types in Linux.
1. <details><summary>Char Module</summary>A character (char) device is one that can be accessed as a stream of bytes (like afile); a char driver is in charge of implementing this behavior. Such a driver usu-ally implements at least the open, close, read, and write system calls. The text console (/dev/console) and the serial ports (/dev/ttyS0 and friends) are examples of char devices, as they are well represented by the stream abstraction. Char devices are accessed by means of filesystem nodes, such as /dev/tty1 and /dev/lp0. The only relevant difference between a char device and a regular file is that you can always move back and forth in the regular file, whereas most char devices are just data channels, which you can only access sequentially. There exist, nonetheless, char devices that look like data areas, and you can move back and forth in them; for instance, this usually applies to frame grabbers, where the applications can access the whole acquired image using mmap or lseek.
</details>


2. <details><summary>Block module</summary>Like char devices, block devices are accessed by filesystem nodes in the /dev directory. A block device is a device (e.g., a disk) that can host a filesystem. In most Unix systems, a block device can only handle I/O operations that transfer one or more whole blocks, which are usually 512 bytes (or a larger power of two) bytes in length. Linux, instead, allows the application to read and write a block device like a char device—it permits the transfer of any number of bytes at a time. As a result, block and char devices differ only in the way data is managed internally by the kernel, and thus in the kernel/driver software interface. Like a char device, each block device is accessed through a filesystem node, and the dif- ference between them is transparent to the user. Block drivers have a completely different interface to the kernel than char drivers. </details>

3. <details><summary>Network module</summary>Any network transaction is made through an interface, that is, a device that is able to exchange data with other hosts. Usually, an interface is a hardware device, but it might also be a pure software device, like the loopback interface. A network interface is in charge of sending and receiving data packets, driven by the network subsystem of the kernel, without knowing how individual transac- tions map to the actual packets being transmitted. Many network connections (especially those using TCP) are stream-oriented, but network devices are, usu- ally, designed around the transmission and receipt of packets. A network driver knows nothing about individual connections; it only handles packets. Not being a stream-oriented device, a network interface isn’t easily mapped to a node in the filesystem, as /dev/tty1 is. The Unix way to provide access to inter- faces is still by assigning a unique name to them (such as eth0), but that name doesn’t have a corresponding entry in the filesystem. Communication between the kernel and a network device driver is completely different from that used with char and block drivers. Instead of read and write, the kernel calls functions related to packet transmission.</details>

# Basics
## Hello World Linux driver ( accessing the pid )

```c
#include <linux/init.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <asm/current.h> // used to get the PID
MODULE_LICENSE("Dual BSD/GPL");
static int hello_init(void)
{
    // EX: 1 Printing Hello World
    printk(KERN_ALERT "Hello, world\n");

    // Ex: 2 THe current is defined in asm/current.h, which gives the pid
    printk(KERN_INFO "The Process is \"%s\" (pid %i)\n", current->comm, current->pid);
    return 0;
}
static void hello_exit(void)
{
    printk(KERN_ALERT "Goodbye, cruel world\n");
}
module_init(hello_init);
module_exit(hello_exit);
```
## linking a module to kernel

## How Module get loadded in the kernel
Interested readers may want to look at how the kernel supports insmod: it relies on a
system call defined in kernel/module.c. The function sys_init_module allocates kernel
memory to hold a module (this memory is allocated with vmalloc; see the section
“vmalloc and Friends” in Chapter 8); it then copies the module text into that mem-
ory region, resolves kernel references in the module via the kernel symbol table, and
calls the module’s initialization function to get everything going.

# Key Points
* As a programmer, you know that an application can call functions it doesn’t define: the linking stage resolves external references using the appropriate library of func- tions. printf is one of those callable functions and is defined in libc. **A module, on the other hand, is linked only to the kernel, and the only functions it can call are the ones exported by the kernel; there are no libraries to link to.** (pg no: 18)
* A module runs in kernel space, whereas applications run in user space. This concept is at the base of operating systems theory.


# DOCUMENTAION LIST
1. File `<kernelSource>/Documentation/changes` tell the required tools and version infos
2. Files in `<kernelSource>/Documentation/kbuild` tells the building or makefile guide


# LOCATIONS
1. lsmod takes information form `/proc/modules`
2. info on loaded modules can be found in `/sys/module`
3. This helps me on take the mipi debug print for camera 0, `echo 0x1f > /sys/class/video4linux/video0/dev_debug`
5. `vermagic.o`: One of the steps in the build process is to link your module
against a file (called vermagic.o) from the current kernel tree; this object contains a fair amount of information about the kernel the module was built for, including the
target kernel version, compiler version, and the settings of a number of important
configuration variables. When an attempt is made to load a module, this informa-
tion can be tested for compatibility with the running kernel. If things don’t match,
the module is not loaded; instead, you see something like:
```bash
# insmod hello.ko
Error inserting './hello.ko': -1 Invalid module format 
```
6. Symbol Table is used to tell the function or variable address in the OS.


# OTHER GENERAL KEYPOINTS
1. Symbol Table is used to tell the function or variable address in the OS.

# File Information
1. `Documentation/kbuild`: To understand the comiling
2. `Documentation/Changes`: List the Required Tools
3. `/proc/modules` or `/sys/modules`: lsmod infos...
4. ``vermagic.o'`` : Before locading the module, kernel use this file to check wheter the modules is suitable for kernel.
5. `/var/log/messages`: you can read the info from here when some proble occurs

# Kernel SOurce file info
1. <linux/sched.h>, scheduling... ( lot of kernel funtion)

# Table info
1. `Kernel Symbol Table`: Stores the exportat symbol, used by the kernel to identify the depent module while using modprobe (ldd, PG.No 28 )
